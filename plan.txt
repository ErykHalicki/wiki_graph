Wikipedia Graph Theory

start time: 10PM October 30

need to make a page (node) base class
stores every link in the page as an edge 
need a hash table which stores all visited pages
start at some page (probably cow)
build out using bfs
iterate through all links on current page, adding them to a "to visit" queue
once every link has been added, add the current link to the visited hash table
at each node, store distance from root. distance of parent + 1

Finish time: 00:45 October 31


Next steps:
implement A*
heuristic will be the similarity between 2 concepts
